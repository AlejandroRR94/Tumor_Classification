# Tumor_Classification

Multiclass classification for brain tumors!

**Data**

The data used for this mini project was taken from the Kaggle Brain Tumor dataset, which can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denizkavi1/brain-tumor.

This dataset contains images for 3 classes of brain tumor:

* meningioma(1)
* glioma(2)
* pituitary tumor(3)

The original dataset was shared by Jun Cheng: Cheng, Jun (2017): brain tumor dataset. figshare. Dataset. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1512427.v5


Notes:
* The model was trained in Google Colab using the GPU available.
  * the weights were used in vscode to make the predictions, hence the absence of the training iterations.
* All used functions in the "Training___Evaluation" notebook are defined in the "utils.py" script
